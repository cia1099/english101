"I see no objections so the next meeting will be on Wednesday the 12th of September at noon."\

Subordinate clauses, namely concessive clauses, time clauses, place clauses, and reason clauses.

* When placed at the beginning or inside, they serve to concede a certain part of an argument before proceeding to question the validity of the point in a given discussion.

* #### Reason Clauses
* "because," "as," "due to," and "that the reason why."

# [Learn how to use the modal verbs "can" and "to be able to"](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/advanced-17-are-you-able-to-spell-this-complicated-name-in-english?lp=270)
* In most case, "can" and "be able to" is the same meaning to express ability. Usually, either of these two forms can be used.
<div class="warning" style='background-color:#E9D8FD; color:#69337A'>

**IMPORTANT:** If someone was in the position to do something, or managed to do something, we use "was"/"were able to" instead of "could."</div> For example:

1. "They were able to get tickets for the concert."
2. "I was able to finish before 6."
3. "I couldn't come last night, sorry. OR I wasn't able to come last night, sorry."

In the negative, "wasn't able to" OR "couldn't" are both correct.

# [Review participles](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/advanced-24-is-your-american-workshop-going-in-the-wrong-direction?lp=270)
#### Participles are used for four main purposes:
1. As the main verb in tenses (这里participle就是指时态)
##### Present Participles
<span style="background-color:yellow">Present participles are used for continuous (or progressive) tenses.</span> These include the present continuous, past continuous and future continuous.
* "The sun was shining so I went for a walk."
* "I'll be playing golf tomorrow at three o'clock."
##### Past Participles
<span style="background-color:yellow">Past participles are used with simple perfect tenses</span> (continuous perfect or progressive perfect tenses take the participle "been" + the present participle - "have been playing," "will have been working," etc.).
* "My workshop focused on alternative energy."
* "That steam would have been kept under high pressure and then used in turbines to generate electricity."
2. As adjectives to describe a noun.
3. As adverbs to describe how something is done, and
4. In phrases that look like clauses combined to provide additional, defining information.

##### Participles Used as Adjectives
* The difference between the present participle and the past participle can make quite a difference in meaning.
1. "The bored man went to sleep during the discussion."
2. "The boring man put other people to sleep during the discussion."

In the first sentence the past participle "bored" is used to mean that the man himself was bored, in the second sentence the present participle "boring" is used to mean that the man was boring to others.
##### Participles Used like Clauses

* ###### Present participle
    <span style="background-color:yellow">The present participle describes an action that is happening at the same time as the action in the main clause.</span>

1. "Who's that boy playing the guitar?" (Who is that boy who is playing the piano?)
2. "Spending all his free-time in the library, he continued to learn outside of class."
The word <font color=cc00ff>'Spending' is a present participle</font> used to describe what he is doing in his free time. This participle clause provides information about the circumstances that led to the action in the main clause <font color=cc00ff>(he continued to learn outside of class).</font>
* ###### Past participle
    <span style="background-color:yellow">The past participle describes a state or condition.</span>
3. "Left alone with nowhere to go, Mary decided to return home a few days early."
The word <font color=cc00ff>'Left' is a past participle</font>. It describes the state Mary was in when she made the decision to return home.

##### Dummy Subject 
refers to the use of "it" or "there" to start a sentence when the true subject follows later.
1. "It is impressive <del>that</del> (the expression <ins>that</ins> I have ever seen)."\
The reason for this correction is that the first sentence was incomplete. The use of "that" here is as a relative pronoun connecting two clauses.\
The ( )parentheses is main subject

"To" is generally used as a preposition or as part of an infinitive verb (e.g., "to run"), while "that" is used as a conjunction to connect clauses or as a relative pronoun.\
Lastly, when you use an infinitive, the action of the verb can indeed be the subject of the sentence.
1. "To read is enjoyable."\
Here, "to read" is the subject of the sentence.
