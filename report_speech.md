# [Using Reported Speech in English](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/advanced-5-using-reported-speech-in-english?lp=270)
Reported speech (also referred to as 'indirect speech') refers to a sentence reporting what someone has said. It is almost always used in spoken English.\
If the reporting verb (i.e., said) is in the past, the reported clause is in a past form. This form is usually one step back into the past from the original:
1. "He said the test was difficult."
2. "She said she watched TV every day."

If simple present, present perfect or the future is used in the reporting verb (i.e., says) the tense is retained:
1. "He says the test is difficult."
2. "She has said that she watches TV every day."
3. "Dustin will say that he comes to school every day."

If reporting a general truth the present tense will be retained:
1. "The teacher said that phrasal verbs are very important."

#### Changing Pronouns and Time Signifiers
When using reported speech, it is often necessary to change the pronouns to match the subject of the sentence:
1. She said, "I want to bring my children." :arrow_right: "She said she wanted to bring her children."
2. Dustin said, "My wife went with me to the show." :arrow_right: "Dustin said his wife had gone with him to the show."

It is also important to change time words (signifiers) when referring to present, past or future time to match the moment of speaking:
1. She said, "I want to bring my children tomorrow." :arrow_right: "She said she wanted to bring her children the next day."
2. Dustin said, "My wife went with me to the show yesterday." :arrow_right: "Dustin said his wife had gone with him to the show the day before."
#### Reporting Questions
When reporting questions, it is especially important to pay attention to sentence order. When reporting yes/no questions, connect the reported question using "if." When reporting questions using question words ("why," "where," "when," etc.) use the question word.
1. She asked, "Do you want to come with me?" :arrow_right: "She asked me if I wanted to come with her."
2. Dave asked, "Where did you go last weekend?" :arrow_right: "Dave asked me where I had gone the previous weekend."
3. He asked, "Why are you studying English?" :arrow_right: "He asked me why I was studying English."
