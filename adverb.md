# Adverb Placement in English
Level 4 Lesson 27

---


Adverbs provide information about how, when, or where something is done. It's easy to understand what adverbs do by breaking the word apart, <span style="background-color:yellow">"ad-" + "-verb": adverbs add something to the verb.</span> Adverbs are actually a category that can be subdivided based on function. Generally, <u><font color=red>adverb placement is taught relative to the type of adverbs.</font></u>

## Adverb Placement: Middle Position

##### * Focusing Adverbs
Placement of focusing adverbs generally takes place in the middle of a sentence, or in the "mid-position." Focusing adverbs put the emphasis on one part of the clause in order to modify, qualify, alter, or add additional information. Adverbs of <u>frequency</u> ("sometimes," "usually," "never," etc.), adverbs of <u>certainty</u> ("probably," "certainly," etc.), and comment adverbs (adverbs expressing an opinion such as "intelligently," "expertly," etc.) can all be used as focusing adverbs.


* For Example:
    1. "Christie calmly put her keys in her purse as she got out of the car."
    2. "We will certainly buy a legal copy of Microsoft Office."
    3. "I don't often go to San Francisco.":heavy_check_mark:\
    "I often don't go to San Francisco.":x:

<div class="warning" style='background-color:#E9D8FD; color:#69337A'>

__Note__: Remember that we always place adverbs of frequency before the main verb rather than the auxiliary verb.
</div>


## Adverb Placement: End Position

##### * Adverbs of Manner
Placement of adverbs of manner usually occurs at the end of a sentence or clause. Adverbs of manner tell us <span style="background-color:yellow">how something is done.</span>

* For Example:
    1. "Alana hasn't done her report accurately.
    2. "Paul does his English homework carefully."

##### * Adverbs of Place

Placement of adverbs of place usually occurs at the end of a sentence or clause. Adverbs of place tell us <span style="background-color:yellow">where something is done.</span>

* For Example:
    1. "Barbara is cooking chicken stock downstairs."
    2. "I'm working in the yard outside."

##### * Adverbs of Time

Placement of adverbs of time usually occurs at the end of the sentence or clause. Adverbs of time tell us <span style="background-color:yellow">when something is done.</span>
* For Example:
    1. "Their meeting took place at nine o'clock."
    2. "Cynthia is going to the dentist tomorrow morning."

## Adverb Placement: Initial Position

Adverb placement at the beginning of a clause or sentence is referred to as "initial position."

##### * Connecting Adverbs

We use initial position adverbs when a connecting adverb joins a statement to the preceding clause or sentence. It's important to remember that these connecting adverbs require adverb placement at the beginning of a phrase in order to connect it to the phrase that comes before.

* List of common connecting adverbs:
    - "however"
    - "consequently"
    - "then"
    - "next"
    - "still"

* For Example:
    1. "Life is hard. However, life can be even harder."
    2. "My friend Jeffrey never enjoyed school. Still, he went and got his degree, and now has a good job."

 

##### * Time Adverbs

We also use time adverbs at the beginning of phrases to indicate when something should happen. It's important to note that time adverbs are the most flexible of all adverbs in their placement.

* For Example:
    1. "Tomorrow, Alexander will travel to his uncle's apartment in New York."
    2. "Sometimes, Sarah enjoys a relaxing day at the park."
