# [Learn about direct and indirect objects](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-8-how-to-keep-american-meetings-on-track)

* #### What Is a Direct Object?
    A direct object is a person or thing that is directly affected by the action of a verb.

    - Nouns as Direct Objects
    - Pronouns as Direct Objects
    - Phrases as Direct Objects
    Gerunds ("-ing" form) and gerund phrases and infinitives ("to do") and infinitive phrases can also function as direct objects.
        1. "I hope to finish soon."\
        "To finish soon" (infinitive phrase) functions as the direct object of the verb "finish."
    - Clauses as Direct Objects

* #### Indirect Objects
    <span style="background-color:yellow">Indirect objects are persons or things that receive the benefits of an action.</span> Generally, however, indirect objects are usually people or groups of people. This is because indirect objects (people) receive the benefit of some action.

* ##### For Example:
    - Nouns as Indirect Objects 
        1. "Renée showed Terry her shoes."
    
        "Terry" is the indirect object, and "issues" (what Renée showed) is the direct object.
    - Pronouns as Indirect Objects
        1. "Big John gave them three weeks to finish the inventory."

        "Them" is the indirect object, and "three weeks to complete the inventory" (what the boss gave) is the direct object.
    - Noun Phrases as Indirect Objects
        1. "The author wrote the patient, faithful readers his last book."

        "The patient, faithful readers" are the indirect object (noun-phrase form), while "his last book" (what the author wrote) is the direct object.
    - Relative Clauses as Indirect Objects
        1. "Lucy promised her husband, who had been waiting for an hour, that she would never be late again."

        In this case, "her husband" is defined by the relative clause "who had been waiting for an hour." Both of these make up the indirect object. "She would never be late again" (what Lucy promised) is the direct object.

# [Alternative Ways to Form Conditional Sentences.](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-9-hoping-for-english-forgiveness/)

#### Alternative Forms for the First Conditional
* #### "Happen to"/"Should Happen to"
These two forms emphasize the chance nature of the conditional. In this way, the condition, which is still true, is even less likely to occur.
1. "If they happen to come to town, we'll have party."
* #### "Provided (That)," "As Long As"
We use "provided (that)" and "as long as" instead of "if" to show specific conditions that must be met in order for something to happen.
1. "Provided he finishes his studies, he'll find an excellent job."

#### Alternative Forms for the Second Conditional
* #### "Were to"
If followed by a subject, "were to" emphasizes the hypothetical character of the statement.
1. "If I were to buy a new car, what would you say?"

* #### "If It Were Not for"
"If it were not for" emphasizes that one event depends on another for completion. We often use this form to show the negative results without a certain person or thing.
1. "If it were not for his decision, this company wouldn't exist."

* #### "Supposing"
We use "supposing" in place of "if" emphasize the imaginary. We more commonly use it in everyday speech.
1. "Supposing he came to visit you, what would you do?"

#### Alternative Forms for the Third Conditional
* #### "But for"
"But for" replaces "if not" and is followed by a noun. We usually use it in formal speech.
1. "But for our savings, we wouldn't have been able to make the payments."
2. "A older country song uses the line 'but for the grace of God go I.'"

* #### "If It Hadn't Been for"
"If it hadn't been for" emphasizes that one event depended on another for completion. We often use this form to show what the negative result would have been without a certain person or thing.
1. "If it hadn't been for Jack, we would have failed."

# [Learn the meaning behind some common English expressions that people often use in the workplace](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-12-avoiding-english-misunderstandings-in-the-workplace)

* #### Getting Attention
1. "Excuse me for interrupting."
2. "May I have a word?"
3. "Could I speak with you?"
* #### Asking for Clarification
This is common when projects are poorly explained. To avoid these kinds of misunderstandings, use phrases like the following:

1. "I don't quite follow you. What exactly do you mean?"
2. "I'm afraid I don't quite understand what you are getting at."
3. "Could you explain to me how that is going to work?"
4. "I don't see what you mean. Could we have some more details, please?"
* #### Clarifying
There are also a number of phrases that we use to introduce explanations or clarification.
1. "Let me put it another way..."
2. "Let me spell out..."

And you can also use several phrases to confirm that your listeners have understood what you said.
1. "Have I made that clear?"
2. "Do you see what I'm getting at?"

# [Learn how to answer job interview questions](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-13-a-relaxed-english-job-interview)

To be clear, it should always be written "have." However, sometimes we can change the pronunciation to "of" because it's easier to say.
* #### "Have" replaced to "Of" in Conditional Forms

"I would <font color=blue>have</font>, but they scare me, June." :point_right: "I would <font color=red>of</font>, but they scare me, June."

# [Learn about how to use relative clauses in English](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-15-going-on-an-american-firing-frenzy)
* ### Non-Defining Relative Clauses
Non-defining relative clauses provide interesting additional information that is not essential to understanding the meaning of the sentence.
1. "Mrs. Jackson, who is very tall, lives on the corner."
* #### Relative Pronouns Used As the Object of Non-Defining Relative Clauses
1. "Peter brought out his favorite antique, which was a bookshelf, to show his friends."
* #### Relative Pronouns Used as a Possessive in Non-Defining Relative Clauses
1. "The singer, whose most recent recording has had much success, was signing autographs."
* #### In non-defining relative clauses, we can use "which" to refer to an entire clause.
1. "He came for the weekend wearing only some shorts and a t-shirt, which was a stupid thing to do."
<div class="warning" style='background-color:#E9D8FD; color:#69337A'>

__NOTE__: After numbers and words like "many," "most," "neither," and "some," we use "of" before "whom" and "which" in non-defining relative clauses.
</div>
1. "Dozens of people had been invited, most of whom I knew."

# [Exceptions to the Simple Present Tense.](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-20-no-news-is-bad-news-in-this-american-office)

* #### Exception 1: Adding Stress
* In order to add stress to a positive sentence, we can use the auxiliary verb "to do."
    -  "No, that's not true. Laura does want to come."

* #### Exception 2: For the Future
* We use the simple present to express future-scheduled events with verbs that express beginning and end or departure and arrival.
    -   A: "When does the train for Paris leave?"
    B: "It leaves at seven tomorrow morning."
* #### Exception 3: When Then?
* The when is expressed with the simple present. The result is expressed with a future form, usually the future with "will." Time clauses are not allowed auxiliary verb "will". Time clauses are introduced by time signifiers such as <span style="background-color:yellow">"when," "as soon as," "before," "after," etc.</span>
    - A: "When are you going to come and see the new house?"
    B: "We will come as soon as we finish the Smith project."

* #### Exception 4: Write a Biography
    - "1911: Pete Wilson is born in Seattle, Washington."
    - "1918: Pete begins to play the saxophone."
* #### Exception 5: Adverbs of Frequency
* We generally put adverbs of frequency such as "regularly," "usually," "normally," "always," "often," "sometimes," "never," etc. before the main verb in present tense.
    -  "John usually arrives home at five o'clock."
    - "Usually, John arrives home at five o'clock."
    - "John arrives home at five o'clock usually."
* #### Exception 7: Negatives First Cause Questions
* These adverbs include "rarely," "never," and "seldom."
    -  "Patricia rarely finishes work before seven p.m."
    - "Seldom does John play volleyball."
<div class="warning" style='background-color:#E9D8FD; color:#69337A'>

__NOTE__:Negative adverbs of frequency that we use in the initial position of a sentence must be followed by question word order!
</div>

A "synergy" is when two inputs create more benefit than the resources required.

# [Adverb Clauses That Show Opposition.](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-21-a-surprise-demotion-at-your-american-job/)
#### "Even Though," "Though," "Although"
"Even though," "though," and "although" are all synonyms.
1. "Even though it was expensive, he bought the car."
2. "Although the course was difficult, he passed with the highest marks."
#### "Whereas," "While"
"Whereas" and "while" show clauses in direct opposition to each other.
1. "Whereas you have lots of time to do your homework, I have very little time indeed."
2. "Mary is rich, while I am poor."
<div class="warning" style='background-color:#E9D8FD; color:#69337A'>

__Note__: that you should always use a comma with "whereas" and "while," regardless of whether the adverb clause begins a sentence or ends it.
</div>

# [Adverb Clauses to Express Conditions and Cause and Effect (I)](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-22-jealousy-rears-its-ugly-head-in-the-us)
* #### "In Case [That]," "In the Event [That]"
"In case" and "in the event" have the same basic meaning as "if" and function much the same way. However, there is an added feeling that you expect the condition won't happen. We use both primarily for future events.
1. "If you need me, I'll be at Sarah's."
2. "In case you need me, I'll be at Sarah's."
3. "I'll be studying upstairs in the event she calls."
* #### "Only If"
"Only if" means "only in the case that something happens-and only if." This form basically means the same as "if." However, it requires that the condition be met for the result to happen.
1. "We'll give you a bicycle only if you do well on your exam."
2. "Only if you do well on your exam will we buy you a bicycle."
<div class="warning" style='background-color:#E9D8FD; color:#69337A'>

__Note__: that when "only if" begins the sentence, you need to invert the main clause.
</div>

* #### "Unless"
"Unless" expresses the idea of "if not."
1. "Unless she hurries up, we won't arrive in time."
2. "We won't go unless he arrives soon."
3. "Unless she hurries up, we won't arrive in time." = "If she doesn't hurry up, we won't arrive in time."
* #### "Whether or Not"
1. "They won't be able to come whether or not they have enough money."
2. "They won't be able to come whether they have enough money or not."
3. "Whether they have money or not, they won't be able to come."

# [Adverb Clauses to Express Conditions and Cause and Effect (II)](https://www.englishclass101.com/lesson/lower-advanced-24-are-you-bad-with-american-names)
* #### "As" and "As Long As"
"As" means the same as "because," but it is preferred to "because" when the adverb clause begins the sentence. We tend to use "as" in more formal, written English. "As long as" means the same as "because," but again it's preferred for starting sentences. We tend to use "as long as" in more informal spoken English.
1. "As the exam will be difficult, you had better get some sleep."
2. "As long as you have the time, why don't you come for a chat?"
* #### "Due to the Fact That"
"Due to the fact that" means the same as "because." We generally use "due to the fact that" in very formal, written English.
1. "We will be staying for an extra week due to the fact that we have not yet finished remodeling your house."
* #### "Inasmuch As"
"Inasmuch as" means the same as because. We use "inasmuch as" in very formal, written English.
1. "Inasmuch as the students had successfully completed their exams, their parents rewarded their efforts by giving them a trip to Paris."
